BIO NOTE

I write science fiction, speculative fiction, short stories, and the occasional piece of memoir. I mostly work by hand at first, using pen and paper to sketch scenes, ideas, or fragments of dialogue. Writing this way helps me think slowly and stay connected to the rhythm of the language. When I move to the computer to edit or expand, I use basic word processors. I’ve never used code or digital tools in my creative practice before now — the tools I use tend to support a linear, character-driven approach and keep things grounded in what feels familiar.


Responding to Digital Writing Collections

From collection 1 - Deviant: The Possession of Christian Shaw by Donna Leishman
This felt really different from everything else I’ve seen so far. It definitely wouldn’t work as a printed story. 
The fact that I had to explore the space by clicking and hovering made it feel more like I was uncovering something than reading it. 
That’s probably what makes it a piece of digital writing, it’s not just the content, but the way the reader interacts with it that creates meaning. I didn’t get a straightforward narrative, but more like a mood or impression. I was confused at first, not sure what I was supposed to do, but once I leaned into that feeling, it kind of made sense. It’s eerie and quiet and unsettling, and I think that works really well with the story it’s telling. I’m still not totally sure I “got it,” but maybe that’s okay, it made me think about how stories can be told through structure, not just text.

From collection 2 - Voyage Into The Unknown by Roderick Coover
I just finished clicking through Voyage Into the Unknown and honestly kind of lost track of time. 
It’s not really a “read this start to finish” thing, it felt more like wandering through a scrapbook or a memory, like you’re not being told a story so much as uncovering one that’s been buried. the old maps and photos made it feel eerie and quiet, like there’s something just out of reach. The interface is a bit clunky, flash really shows its age and a couple times I wasn’t sure if I was doing something wrong or if the story was just being intentionally hard to access (probably both?). Still, the nonlinear structure was cool, it let me make my own connections. Not sure I “got” the whole thing, but maybe that’s the point. more vibe than plot. it’s definitely digital in the way it forces you to interact. just reading wouldn’t have the same effect.

From collection 3 - The Silent Numbers by Matthew Kirkpatrick
This one is weird and I’m not sure I get it as ‘literature’, digital or otherwise.
This feels like listening in on secret transmissions, text flickers then disappears as number voices and static wash over me. It’s definitely digital writing because it uses a web interface plus audio and the words aren’t fixed; they glitch in and out in sync with the broadcasting hiss. The numbers carry mystery rather than meaning, there’s this haunting energy even when I don’t understand a thing: voices reading digits, mingled with noise, like background music and code fused .

What stands out is the atmosphere., it’s immersive and unnerving. I like that it doesn’t explain itself; it trusts me to feel the tingle of surveillance or paranoia. I wish there was a bit more anchoring though, maybe a hint of why I’m listening,  but then maybe the point is that there is no reason.

From collection 4 - How to Rob a Bank by Alan Bigelow
At first I wasn’t sure what was happening—it just looked like someone flipping through a phone. But then I realised the whole story plays out through these little swipes: search histories, notes apps, GPS, even a meditation app. It’s kind of hilarious and kind of sad? The main character is clearly clueless, like he’s googling “how to rob a bank” and expecting good advice. But somehow it works. The humour sneaks up on you, especially when you start piecing together the relationship between him and the woman he's texting.
What makes this digital writing is that it couldn’t exist as just a short story in print—it’s the way the interface mimics a phone that gives it its shape. The medium is the narrative. I liked how natural it felt to navigate, almost like I was snooping on someone’s phone, which is maybe the point. Not super deep, but smart in how it uses form.



Responding to Taroko Gorge, The Gathering Cloud, First Draft of the Revolution and Shade

Taroko Gorge by Nick Montfort
What elements of this piece do you read?
The constantly generating poetic lines that move down the screen. It’s a looping, ever-changing text made from a limited word pool, forming different naturalistic and sometimes abstract imagery.
How are those elements meaningful?
The repetition and variation start to feel meditative. It’s not about a narrative or linear development but more about rhythm, atmosphere, and noticing how small changes shift tone. There's something hypnotic about it, it invites you to read slowly, or just observe.
How is the work read differently from print literature?
There’s no beginning or end. You can’t “finish” it the way you would a printed poem. The act of reading becomes more ambient, it’s about catching fragments, letting meaning float in and out rather than controlling the pace or sequence.
The Gathering Cloud by J.R. Carpenter
What elements of this piece do you read?
 The scrolling text blocks combined with hovering cloud imagery. The visuals aren’t just decorative, they sometimes disrupt or overlay the text, making reading feel more layered.
How are those elements meaningful?
 The cloud metaphor works on multiple levels, weather, data storage, environmental issues. The poetic language is mixed with facts and citations, which complicates what counts as poetic or informational. It feels political and self-aware.
How is the work read differently from print literature?
 It demands attention to how images and text play together. It’s nonlinear, you explore instead of follow. It also asks you to slow down, to wait for the screen to respond, which becomes part of the experience.

First Draft of the Revolution by Emily Short & Liza Daly
What elements of this piece do you read?
You read letters between characters, but also the process of revision, crossed-out lines, edited phrases, rewritten passages. It’s not just the final letter but the act of composing it.
How are those elements meaningful?
The revisions reveal the power dynamics at play, what can or can’t be said, who’s allowed to speak honestly. It makes visible the hidden work behind communication and shows how language gets shaped by fear or expectation.
How is the work read differently from print literature?
Instead of passively reading a letter, you participate in the writing process. You click to remove and replace lines, guiding the character’s voice. That kind of interaction would be impossible in print, it’s about shaping the story as you go.

Shade by Andrew Plotkin
What elements of this piece do you read?
You read short text descriptions of rooms and objects, plus your own typed commands (e.g., “get bottle,” “sleep”). It’s like a conversation between you and the game parser.
How are those elements meaningful?
The setting slowly shifts and dissolves, and your actions affect the environment in unsettling ways. It feels claustrophobic and disorienting, which matches the themes of isolation or unreality. The minimalism adds to the eerie mood.
How is the work read differently from print literature?
It’s interactive in a literal sense, you’re not just reading, you’re inputting commands and navigating space. It unfolds based on your choices and inferences, which creates a sense of embodiment and agency that’s totally different from reading a printed story.

How is e-lit different from print literature?
E-lit often changes or moves, and it usually invites you to interact with it. It can include images, sound, and code, and sometimes it only exists in real time. Unlike print, it can be infinite or generate new combinations each time. You’re not just reading—you’re navigating, choosing, waiting, or even typing. That changes how meaning is made. It’s more about experience and engagement than passive reading.

What are the qualities of the works we might consider qualities of e-literature?
Some shared qualities are interactivity, procedural generation, multimodality (text, visuals, sound), and nonlinearity. They often play with interface or ask the reader to participate in meaning-making. They might rely on digital structures like links or code, and they’re usually self-aware about what reading or writing even means in a digital context.



REMIX Excercises

What aspects of the remix are the same?
The basic structure hasn’t really changed — it’s still a set of lists that the computer pulls from to mash together little poetic fragments. It’s modular and random, and that part’s stayed consistent. I'm still using categories like "subjects," "verbs," and "objects" (or search phrases), and the code is doing the heavy lifting in combining them. The remix is built on the same foundation — just swapping out the content.

What aspects of the remix are different?
The vibe is completely different now. Originally, it was funny and kind of absurd — Garfield, cheese, talking about lasagna. Now it’s dark, kind of eerie, definitely more serious. The new phrases are pulling in stuff like family law, domestic violence, digital surveillance — they feel way more grounded in real life, even though they’re being used in a poetic way. Same with the subject/verb/object stuff — it’s gone from “robots wandering wastelands” to something more like spiritual decay and weird future prophecy. Same engine, new fuel.

Is the remix successful (why or why not)?
I think it is — it surprised me in a good way. I didn’t expect that just changing the words in a few arrays would shift the tone this much. It feels like the same tool is suddenly doing something much heavier and more layered. I’m still figuring out how coding and poetry work together, but this made me realise how much the input shapes the output, even if the structure stays the same. So yeah, the remix works, because it shows that you can get something strange and meaningful out of a pretty simple system — especially when the language is doing something emotional or unsettling.


How do you feel about coding now versus how you felt going into this in Week 1?

Honestly, in Week 1 I was kind of intimidated, but also somewhat disinterested. The class was not what I had imagined it to be and I was not looking forward to learning to code, I've actively avoided doing do for many years. I didn’t really see how it could connect with the emotional or creative stuff I care about. But now, after actually working with it a bit and seeing how something small, like changing a word list, can totally shift the meaning or tone, I feel more open to it, even if I don't think it will play much of a part in my writing practice beyond class. 

I can now see it’s not just about functionality. Coding can be expressive. It’s almost like poetry in its own right: about structure, rhythm, constraints, and play.

Has your hands-on engagement with interactive digital literature shifted the way that you 'read' e-lit? In what ways?

Yeah, for sure. Before, I think I saw e-lit as this kind of glitchy, maybe even gimmicky thing, like it was trying to be different for the sake of being different. But now, after actually building something (even something simple), I’ve started to notice the choices behind the scenes: the pacing, the logic, the way readers are guided or disrupted. I’m paying attention to the design now — not just the content, but how it’s delivered, how the interaction works. I notice things like: "Why did they make me click here? Why is this fragment looped? What’s being left unsaid in the code?" It feels less like reading a page and more like navigating a system — which is weird, but kind of exciting.


Defining Electronic Literature

Reading the pieces Taroko Gorge, The Gathering Cloud, First Draft of the Revolution, and Shade challenged a lot of what I previously understood literature to be. Coming from a print-based background, especially in fiction and speculative fiction, I’m used to linear narratives and static texts. These works felt alive — not just in content, but in how they demanded my attention, how they moved, and how I moved through them.

In Taroko Gorge, what I “read” wasn’t just the words on the screen, but the system behind them. It’s a generative poem, which means the text is continuously produced by an underlying code rather than fixed on the page. I was reading patterns, noticing repetitions, and feeling the rhythm of something not written once, but written endlessly. This changed how I thought about authorship — there’s a sort of tension between the human hand and the algorithmic process. It reminded me of what N. Katherine Hayles says in Electronic Literature: What Is It? — that electronic literature is “digital born,” and can’t be experienced fully if printed out. That’s certainly true here: the meaning comes from the movement, the unfolding process, the unfinishability of it. You don’t “finish” Taroko Gorge so much as you witness it.

The Gathering Cloud, by contrast, is more essayistic — it combines poetic fragments with visual layering and interactive movement between panels. It deals with climate change and data, so the digital form mirrors its content: weightless information, heavy implications. What I’m reading here isn’t just text or imagery but juxtaposition, delay, the effect of hovering and clicking. There's a resistance to immediacy. As Berens argued in Week 1, e-lit can open up different epistemological models — not just what we know, but how we come to know it. The layering in The Gathering Cloud builds that kind of fragmented understanding, where meaning accrues slowly, atmospherically. It’s a “slow read” in a very literal sense.

First Draft of the Revolution is perhaps the closest to my usual reading habits — it’s structured as a series of letters, but the interface makes the act of writing visible. You don’t just read the letter; you watch it get rewritten, edited, and altered. This draws attention to the act of composition, showing how communication is shaped by social norms, self-censorship, and power. This made me think of Berens’ point that not all e-lit is about “playing with code” — sometimes it’s about exposing the structures we take for granted. This piece also made me think back to the Deleuzian idea of the rhizome (Week 3) — the way meaning here emerges from branching possibilities rather than a single, linear truth.

Finally, Shade was the most “game-like” of the four, but also the most disorienting. I was reading the environment, my own choices, and the emotional undertow of a seemingly mundane apartment that gradually reveals something more surreal. As with riddles, described by Montfort in Week 2, part of the “reading” is puzzle-solving — decoding what’s really happening, interpreting the rules of the world. The commands I typed, the frustration of not getting a response, even that experience was part of the text. The opacity was meaningful — it forced me to sit with ambiguity and pay attention to what wasn’t being said.

All of these works differ from print literature not just in format, but in fundamental ways of engaging. Reading isn’t passive — it’s exploratory, iterative, and sometimes frustrating. Unlike a novel where the story will continue whether I’m confused or not, here my participation directly affects the experience. Hayles talks about this as the “cybernetic loop” — reader and machine in a feedback relationship. I felt that loop most in Shade, where the interface itself became part of the emotional tone, but even in Taroko Gorge there’s a sense that I’m collaborating with the system just by watching it unfold.

So how is electronic literature different from print? It’s not just “literature on a screen.” It’s often multimodal — combining text, image, sound, and interactivity — and it’s shaped by computation. It foregrounds process over product, often requiring the reader to “perform” the text in some way. It can break down boundaries between genres, disciplines, and even reader and writer. As Berens and Hayles both point out, it’s a field that resists being pinned down — which is part of its power.

Some qualities that seem central to electronic literature include interactivity, procedurality (being rule-based or system-driven), nonlinearity, and a kind of self-awareness about medium. These works draw attention to their own construction. They often ask: how is this being made? And what does that making say about the world? That awareness seems essential — not just to the texts themselves, but to the practice of reading them.


Algorith and Constraint

An algorithm is basically a set of instructions or steps that carry out a specific task, like a recipe, but for processing information. In digital writing, algorithms can generate text, structure interactivity, or even create entire works based on programmed conditions. A constraint, on the other hand, is a rule or limitation imposed on the writing process, like only using certain words, writing without a particular letter, or sticking to a rigid structure or theme.

I’ve started to realise I already use both, even if I didn’t think of them as “algorithmic” or “constrained” before. For example, when I sit down to write speculative fiction, I often start with a world-building prompt, something like “What if a society existed without memory?”, and then I work within that premise. That’s a constraint. I also use structure in scripts or short fiction that follow certain beats, setup, conflict, turning point, which is a kind of informal algorithm. Even just having a writing routine, or using tools like a prompt generator or outlining system, brings a level of systematisation to the process.

The Oulipo writers were fascinated by this kind of stuff, they treated literature like a playground for experimentation. Their whole idea was that constraints didn’t kill creativity, they fuelled it. They were interested in the intersection of maths and literature because mathematical patterns and structures could be used to generate or reshape writing in unexpected ways. It’s weird, but kind of liberating, instead of chasing originality through pure “inspiration,” they leaned into systems and rules. In a way, they externalised part of the writing process, just like digital writers do with code.

Algorithmic writing challenges the old idea of the author as the sole creative force. It shifts attention to process, and to the systems behind the text. If a poem is generated by code, who’s the author, the person who wrote the code? The computer? The person clicking through? It gets murky. But I don’t think it devalues creativity, it just reframes it. Instead of being the source of every word, the writer becomes more like a designer of conditions, or a collaborator with systems. That’s something I’m still trying to wrap my head around, but it’s starting to make sense as I engage more with electronic literature.

LIPOGRAMS

I chose this excerpt from Dante's Inferno as I've been re-reading it recently.

An extravagant clock ticked softly at the other side of his bedchamber. Dante has been asleep for three hours. Once, Dante was capable of fighting for days without rest. Now he took sleep when he could and woke weary from it. If he could, he would have enjoyed the Long Sleep. Corbulo warned him from the sarcophagi. There were risks for Dante hidden in the holy machines. Age. All down to his damned age. He tested his face in his hands. The texture of his wrinkled skin disturbed him, for a dreaming man never sees himself old. He remained that way for several minutes, breathing slowly until the air passing in and out of his lungs absorbed his attention and calmed him. With a quick, decisive breath, he threw back the covers and rose from his bed. His muscles ached, an old man's pain afflicting an immortal. Rotations of his shoulders worked out some of the stiffness, but by no means at all.

- The Letter E

A grand clock softly rang at that far part of my room.
I had lain dormant for many hours.
Long ago, I could combat for days, no nap.
Now, slumber was a luxury.
If an option, my soul would grasp at long calm.
Corbulo had cautions—crypt-born warnings.
My risks lay in holy constructs.
Aging.

- The Letter O

An extravagant timepiece clicked faintly at the far side
 his chamber. Dante had slumbered a few times.
 Once, Dante was capable af lasting in battle many days.
 At present, he naps when he can, and arises weary.
 If he may, he shall have relished eternal slumber.
 The dead man gave fair warning.
 There are hazards inside the sacred machine.
 Age. It all ends in age.

- The Prisoner's Constraint

An arcane cura rang afar in air.
 An aura as no ear can mar.
 An asana: war ran raw—via arcana, war ran.
 Awake, sane, rare as a warm aura.

This last one is much harder obviously


Mesostics

Worn from a vigil, he turnEd to rising air  
      The clock ticked no Sooner than sleep began  
          Dante could not Cruel time’s return  
            Now he would hAve taken the sarcophagi’s gift  
                The old maP had no route to youth  
       His age caught him Evading rest

N+7

An extravagant cloister ticked softly at the other sideline of his bee.
Dante has been asleep for three houseflies.
Once, Dante was capable of fig tree for deadlines without restaurant.
Now he took sleigh when he could and woke weary from it.
If he could, he would have enjoyed the Long Sleigh.
Corbulo warned him from the sassafras.
There were rivulets for Dante hidden in the holy machetes.
Agency.
All down to his damned agency.
