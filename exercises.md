BIO NOTE

I write science fiction, speculative fiction, short stories, and the occasional piece of memoir. I mostly work by hand at first, using pen and paper to sketch scenes, ideas, or fragments of dialogue. Writing this way helps me think slowly and stay connected to the rhythm of the language. When I move to the computer to edit or expand, I use basic word processors. I’ve never used code or digital tools in my creative practice before now — the tools I use tend to support a linear, character-driven approach and keep things grounded in what feels familiar.


Responding to Digital Writing Collections

From collection 1 - Deviant: The Possession of Christian Shaw by Donna Leishman
This felt really different from everything else I’ve seen so far. It definitely wouldn’t work as a printed story. 
The fact that I had to explore the space by clicking and hovering made it feel more like I was uncovering something than reading it. 
That’s probably what makes it a piece of digital writing, it’s not just the content, but the way the reader interacts with it that creates meaning. I didn’t get a straightforward narrative, but more like a mood or impression. I was confused at first, not sure what I was supposed to do, but once I leaned into that feeling, it kind of made sense. It’s eerie and quiet and unsettling, and I think that works really well with the story it’s telling. I’m still not totally sure I “got it,” but maybe that’s okay, it made me think about how stories can be told through structure, not just text.

From collection 2 - Voyage Into The Unknown by Roderick Coover
I just finished clicking through Voyage Into the Unknown and honestly kind of lost track of time. 
It’s not really a “read this start to finish” thing, it felt more like wandering through a scrapbook or a memory, like you’re not being told a story so much as uncovering one that’s been buried. the old maps and photos made it feel eerie and quiet, like there’s something just out of reach. The interface is a bit clunky, flash really shows its age and a couple times I wasn’t sure if I was doing something wrong or if the story was just being intentionally hard to access (probably both?). Still, the nonlinear structure was cool, it let me make my own connections. Not sure I “got” the whole thing, but maybe that’s the point. more vibe than plot. it’s definitely digital in the way it forces you to interact. just reading wouldn’t have the same effect.

From collection 3 - The Silent Numbers by Matthew Kirkpatrick
This one is weird and I’m not sure I get it as ‘literature’, digital or otherwise.
This feels like listening in on secret transmissions, text flickers then disappears as number voices and static wash over me. It’s definitely digital writing because it uses a web interface plus audio and the words aren’t fixed; they glitch in and out in sync with the broadcasting hiss. The numbers carry mystery rather than meaning, there’s this haunting energy even when I don’t understand a thing: voices reading digits, mingled with noise, like background music and code fused .

What stands out is the atmosphere., it’s immersive and unnerving. I like that it doesn’t explain itself; it trusts me to feel the tingle of surveillance or paranoia. I wish there was a bit more anchoring though, maybe a hint of why I’m listening,  but then maybe the point is that there is no reason.

From collection 4 - How to Rob a Bank by Alan Bigelow
At first I wasn’t sure what was happening—it just looked like someone flipping through a phone. But then I realised the whole story plays out through these little swipes: search histories, notes apps, GPS, even a meditation app. It’s kind of hilarious and kind of sad? The main character is clearly clueless, like he’s googling “how to rob a bank” and expecting good advice. But somehow it works. The humour sneaks up on you, especially when you start piecing together the relationship between him and the woman he's texting.
What makes this digital writing is that it couldn’t exist as just a short story in print—it’s the way the interface mimics a phone that gives it its shape. The medium is the narrative. I liked how natural it felt to navigate, almost like I was snooping on someone’s phone, which is maybe the point. Not super deep, but smart in how it uses form.



Responding to Taroko Gorge, The Gathering Cloud, First Draft of the Revolution and Shade

Taroko Gorge by Nick Montfort
What elements of this piece do you read?
The constantly generating poetic lines that move down the screen. It’s a looping, ever-changing text made from a limited word pool, forming different naturalistic and sometimes abstract imagery.
How are those elements meaningful?
The repetition and variation start to feel meditative. It’s not about a narrative or linear development but more about rhythm, atmosphere, and noticing how small changes shift tone. There's something hypnotic about it, it invites you to read slowly, or just observe.
How is the work read differently from print literature?
There’s no beginning or end. You can’t “finish” it the way you would a printed poem. The act of reading becomes more ambient, it’s about catching fragments, letting meaning float in and out rather than controlling the pace or sequence.
The Gathering Cloud by J.R. Carpenter
What elements of this piece do you read?
 The scrolling text blocks combined with hovering cloud imagery. The visuals aren’t just decorative, they sometimes disrupt or overlay the text, making reading feel more layered.
How are those elements meaningful?
 The cloud metaphor works on multiple levels, weather, data storage, environmental issues. The poetic language is mixed with facts and citations, which complicates what counts as poetic or informational. It feels political and self-aware.
How is the work read differently from print literature?
 It demands attention to how images and text play together. It’s nonlinear, you explore instead of follow. It also asks you to slow down, to wait for the screen to respond, which becomes part of the experience.

First Draft of the Revolution by Emily Short & Liza Daly
What elements of this piece do you read?
You read letters between characters, but also the process of revision, crossed-out lines, edited phrases, rewritten passages. It’s not just the final letter but the act of composing it.
How are those elements meaningful?
The revisions reveal the power dynamics at play, what can or can’t be said, who’s allowed to speak honestly. It makes visible the hidden work behind communication and shows how language gets shaped by fear or expectation.
How is the work read differently from print literature?
Instead of passively reading a letter, you participate in the writing process. You click to remove and replace lines, guiding the character’s voice. That kind of interaction would be impossible in print, it’s about shaping the story as you go.

Shade by Andrew Plotkin
What elements of this piece do you read?
You read short text descriptions of rooms and objects, plus your own typed commands (e.g., “get bottle,” “sleep”). It’s like a conversation between you and the game parser.
How are those elements meaningful?
The setting slowly shifts and dissolves, and your actions affect the environment in unsettling ways. It feels claustrophobic and disorienting, which matches the themes of isolation or unreality. The minimalism adds to the eerie mood.
How is the work read differently from print literature?
It’s interactive in a literal sense, you’re not just reading, you’re inputting commands and navigating space. It unfolds based on your choices and inferences, which creates a sense of embodiment and agency that’s totally different from reading a printed story.

How is e-lit different from print literature?
E-lit often changes or moves, and it usually invites you to interact with it. It can include images, sound, and code, and sometimes it only exists in real time. Unlike print, it can be infinite or generate new combinations each time. You’re not just reading—you’re navigating, choosing, waiting, or even typing. That changes how meaning is made. It’s more about experience and engagement than passive reading.

What are the qualities of the works we might consider qualities of e-literature?
Some shared qualities are interactivity, procedural generation, multimodality (text, visuals, sound), and nonlinearity. They often play with interface or ask the reader to participate in meaning-making. They might rely on digital structures like links or code, and they’re usually self-aware about what reading or writing even means in a digital context.
